### What I learned & Continued development

This project was a fun way to test my knowledge of HTML and CSS. As you can see, my QR code comes close to the design, but not without a few challenges. My first challenge was calculating a suitable width for the box that contains the QR image and text, as they needed to be legible and flexible to a viewer's preferences and viewport. Through trial and error, I believe I obtained a suitable size while avoiding the elements from being too cramped. Speaking of, this led to my second hurdle: margins versus padding.

This project made me realise that I did not thoroughly understand the Box Model - constantly switching between using padding or margins to create space within the box and make it pleasing to the eye. I had to review my notes and revisit the MDN Web Docs to understand what to choose over the other. 

MDC Web Docs helped me learn CSS values that I had not drilled down on. In particular, border radius and shadow. Ultimately, choosing what I thought was close to the original design, I am keen on integrating this newly found tips in future projects.
